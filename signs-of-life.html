		<hr />
<p>It's been about two months since I posted an update on the status of Menuwatch. Not cool. Without further ado:</p>
<h4>What Works</h4>
<ul>
<li>Menuwatch has a beautiful splash page with amusing CSS animations that I spent far too long coding for how many devices support them.</li>
<li>The sign-up page, while currently blocked with a "be patient!"-gate, can create a new used and send them an email with a confirmation link.</li>
<li>The account page allows you to view all of your watches, and remove them if you wish. It displays options for modifying the two settings provided to users: email frequency and location. Account deletion and password changes (though not resets) are supported.</li>
<li>You can give me money! Account upgrades are tested and working, using Stripe as the payment processor.</li>
<li>The basic food view, which lists the thirty next upcoming foods, works (although the upcoming dates are wrong).</li>
<li>The popularity food view allows you to see which foods are watched by the most people.</li>
<li>The search view allows you to do an exact-text search for a food you like. </li>
<li>All food views allow addition and deletion of watches over AJAX, with an animation indicating progress to be displayed over slow connections.</li>
<li>Most of the functionality available on the account and food pages works via an API that may or may not be a teapot.</li>
<li>Menu acquisition runs nightly, and is fairly resistant to errors caused by mis-formatting by Dining employees. Issues exist here with the task that moves upcoming foods to past foods once their date passes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What Doesn't</h4>
<ul>
<li>Mobile support is iffy. The worst of it is the table for foods, which just plain isn't responsive. Bootstrap may have developed a solution for this since 3.0 went out of beta, or I may just be using it wrong.</li>
<li>People get alerts for foods they're not watching. Outbound email has been disabled for the greater part of a month while I try to find time to search for the cause of the issue.</li>
<li>Past foods don't always "pop." A certain number of foods on the <em>n</em>th of the month will still show up as upcoming when it becomes the <em>n+1</em>th of the month. I believe this bug is related to transactions in Postgres, and I've been playing with Django's manual commit and rollback abilities to try to fix it with little success.</li>
<li>The 'recent' foods page doesn't work. At all.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Game Plan</h4>
<p>I'm currently planning on devoting a large part of Thanksgiving Break to getting Menuwatch off the ground. I'm also planning on using Thanksgiving to catch up on school, write a paper, do Christmas shopping, get to Inbox Zero, and find a job. So we'll see how that goes.</p>
<h4>As always</h4>
<p>Menuwatch is looking for beta testers. You'll get a free pro account, and if I ever order branded #swag, you'll get some of that for free, too.
