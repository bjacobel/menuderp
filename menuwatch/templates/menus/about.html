            Finding the foods you love at the best college dining in the world shouldn't be hard. That's why Menuwatch exists: to make the dining experience of Bowdoin students easier and more fun. 
            <br/><br/>
            The idea is simple â€” sign in, find a food you love, and add it to your account. When Menuwatch sees that your food is coming up at Moulton or Thorne, we'll send you an alert.
            <br/><br/>
            Menuwatch was developed over the summer of 2013 by <a href="mailto:bjacobel@gmail.com">Brian Jacobel</a>. You can learn more about its development and process on the <a href="http://news.menuwat.ch">blog</a>, or view the source on <a href="https://github.com/bjacobel/menuwatch">GitHub</a>.
