This post is for those of you interested in how Menuwatch was built and runs. 

#####Basics
Menuwatch is built on version 1.5 of [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), a Python web framework. The project is based on [rdegges' Django skeleton](http://django-skel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), which is fantastic at eliminating the tedium of configuring a Django app to play nicely with addons like [South](http://south.aeracode.org/) and [Celery](http://celeryproject.org/).

#####Front-end
Menuwatch uses the 3.0 RC of the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework. Its JavaScript is extended with [jQuery 1.10](http://jquery.com/).   

#####Back-end
Menuwatch is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Its database backend is [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/), though I use [MariaDB](http://mariadb.org) locally because there aren't any good GUI Postgres clients. Menuwatch's static assets are hosted on [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to reduce Heroku load, using the [django-storages](http://django-storages.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) module. 

#####Development 
I develop on a MacBook Pro using [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) and [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html). I isolate my Python environment with [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and use [Sequel Pro](http://www.sequelpro.com/) for GUI SQL management.

#####Blogging
This blog is based on [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.2/), a static site generator in Python. The theme is forked from wting's [pelican-svbtle](https://github.com/wting/pelican-svbtle), inspired by [Svbtle](https://svbtle.com/)'s interface. Hosting is done on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/).

#####Speaking of GitHub…
… all of Menuwatch's code is Git-controlled and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/bjacobel/menuwatch). Fork me.
