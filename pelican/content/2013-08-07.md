Welcome to the blog of Menuwatch, a new website aimed at making the dining experience of Bowdoin students easier and more fun. This post will be the first of many about the process of building my first public web app and sharing it with the public. As (if?) the service matures, I'll also use this as a place to communicate with users about new features and feedback. If you haven't yet, please visit [Menuwatch](http://www.menuwat.ch) and give it a spin!
