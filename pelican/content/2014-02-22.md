About a month ago I fixed every critical bug in Menuwatch (that I knew of) and started releasing it to a few of my friends. With their help, I've tracked down all the noncritical bugs and made a few user interface improvements, as well as cleaning up some code that I now know how to do more elegantly in Django. While Menuwatch will continue to grow and improve, I'm going to go ahead and call the code I pushed earlier today Menuwatch's 1.0 release. Exciting. If you don't have an account yet, [give it a spin](http://menuwat.ch/signup).
