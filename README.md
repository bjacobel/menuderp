# MenuWatch


### The menu tracker for Bowdoin students.

Do you love Hungarian Mushroom Soup, but always forget and go to Thorne when it's at Moulton? 

Do you live in the Android/Windows Phone ghetto, forever deprived of the ability to find out what's for dinner?

Are your friends lazy shits who don't even bother checking menus because Moulton is like, so far away? 

Do you *really, fucking love* Hungarian Mushroom Soup?

**MenuWatch is for you.**

#### The Pitch
The site hasn't launched yet, but when it does - [send me an email](mailto:bjacobel@gmail.com) if you're interested in beta testing, or just [head over to the site](http://menuwat.ch) and start kicking the tires. Find a bug (and have it confirmed by me that said bug is reproduceable/significant/not actually a feature/etc) and I'll give you a free upgrade to a Pro account. Sound good? Good.
