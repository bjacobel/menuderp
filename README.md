# Menuwatch


### The menu tracker for Bowdoin students.

Do you love Hungarian Mushroom Soup, but always forget and go to Thorne when it's at Moulton? 

Do you live in the Android/Windows Phone ghetto, forever deprived of the ability to find out what's for dinner?

Are your friends lazy shits who don't even bother checking menus because Moulton is like, so far away? 

Do you *really, fucking love* Hungarian Mushroom Soup?

**Menuwatch is for you.**

#### Planned Features 

* Track your favorite menu items at Moulton and Thorne and recieve email alerts when they're coming up
* Customize your alerts: see the next day, three days, or week at a glance. Don't ever go to Moulton? Enable alerts for Thorne only.
* See what foods are recent or popular, and add them to your alerts instantly


#### The Pitch
The isn't quite ready yet, but when it is - [send me an email](mailto:bjacobel@gmail.com) if you're interested in beta testing, or just [head over to the site](http://menuwat.ch) and start kicking the tires. Find a bug (and have it confirmed by me that said bug is reproduceable/significant/not actually a feature/etc) and I'll give you a free upgraded account. Sound good? Good.
